# Difficult Math Problems Solver - (ON HOLD)  

## Description 

Building a web application to solve challenging math problems that standard Large Language Model (LLM) prompting cannot handle accurately. 

My approach is based on my work in  the [AI Mathematical Olympiad](https://aimoprize.com/) particularly my participation in the [Progress Prize 2 competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ai-mathematical-olympiad-progress-prize-2/) on  Kaggle

Building with Python, the app focuses on providing accurate and detailed answers for advanced mathematical difficult problems.
This repository meant to feature detailed code explanations, deployment instructions, and a live demo showcasing the tool's potential for researchers, students, and educators seeking a robust math-solving assistant.
