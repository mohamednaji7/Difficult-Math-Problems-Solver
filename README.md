# Difficult Math Problems Solver - (In Progress)  

## Description 

Building a web application to solve challenging math problems that standard Large Language Model (LLM) prompting cannot handle accurately. By integrating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, this app enhances LLM capabilities by querying relevant mathematical resources and leveraging retrieved context to produce correct solutions.


This approach is based on my work in  the [AI Mathematical Olympiad](https://aimoprize.com/) particularly my participation in the [Progress Prize 2 competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ai-mathematical-olympiad-progress-prize-2/) on  Kaggle

Building with Python, the app focuses on providing accurate and detailed answers for advanced mathematical diffcult probelms.
This repository meant to features detailed code explanations, deployment instructions, and a live demo showcasing the tool's potential for researchers, students, and educators seeking a robust math-solving assistant.
